Now, I felt the will to embrace the tech and settle with it. Nakakatuwa lang din dahil for the first time in my life naging desido rin ako sa gusto kong tahakin sa buhay.

            <p class="yy"><sup title="Introduction">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before taking up computer science, I had little knowledge about the potential jobs/careers after finishing college—Developer, Web Designer, Data Analyst, and Technicians. Even with little knowledge, I decided to pursue computer science with a plan of being a Data Analyst afterwards. I wasn’t 100% decided on being a Data Analyst, all I knew is that I need to choose something tech related. As I’ve mentioned, I grew up having business as my main career goal. I believe it’s influenced by my situation of being a tindera sa Sari-Sari store ni mama ever since I was a kid. I have always found myself negotiating with other people whenever they transact with me with any product or service. Maski paninda ni mama binebenta ko rin sa school ko dati para may dagdag baon. But, everything changed when I learned deeper information regarding the possible career track in the tech field.  I had this long talk with my relative regarding how people who pursued tech in college or any related tech, most of them succeeded in life by being a system engineer. I got intrigued with how they worked and soon grabbed my interest in being one. To this day, I aspire to be a system engineer, although I still have no specific industry I want to partake in yet, I believe that it’s something I need to work on because being a system engineer can’t be replaced by AI– or at least in the near future.</sup></p>
            
            
            <p class="yy"><sup title="Conclusion">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I may have decided on an ideal plan in my head right now, I still won’t rely on a single plan solely. All that matters now is that I am making progress and I am willing to devote my time, mind, and heart in achieving something. Regardless of what my career will be, all I hope is for it to be helpful for my growth as an individual. To myself 5 or 10 years from now, I hope you’re winning in life.</sup></p>
